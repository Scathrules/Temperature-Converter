# Temperature-Converter
A small application for converting temperatures. Converts a given temperature to Fahrenheit, Celsius, or Kelvins. 

Input a number in the entry box and choose the initial and desired temperature unit from the first and second combo box, respectively. Click the right arrow button to convert the entry into the desired temperature. The resulting value is rounded up to 2 decimal places.

Potential errors (e.g. inputting non-numerical values) will make the button do nothing if clicked on thus preventing any problems.
